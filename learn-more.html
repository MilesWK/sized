  Redesigned sized, added footer, improved JS and CSS

in case you don't like it, I made a backup of the original located at /old, but if you switch to the old one please still keep this one somewhere e.g. inside a folder

Wow! This looks awesome! Thanks for the back up, but I love the updates! Thanks, Tiago!

          <p>
            Sized is a simple tool to allow developers to test out there
            websites on various device widths. Depending on how you style the
            page, a website could look good for a PC, but when you put it on a
            phone, the website may become jumbled up and messy. This tool allows
            you to enter a URL, and see how it will look on devices such as a
            phone without needing a phone.
